# Face-Morphing
Matlab code to create a gif of morphing one face into another. Find tie points manually in the two images using cpselect tool. Points on features such as eyes, ears and mouth corners work the best.

## Example
<p align="center">
  <img src="Sample/from.jpg" width = 200> <img src = "Sample/to.jpg" width = 200>
  <br><b>Result</b><br>
  <img src="Sample/sample.gif" width = 200>
</p>
